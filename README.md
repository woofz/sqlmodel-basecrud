# SQLModel BaseCRUD
###### *Simple package that provides base CRUD operations for your models.*

### What is SQLModel BaseCRUD?
With SQLModel BaseCRUD, you can implement your CRUD operation easily in your project. It is simple as declaring a variable!
This package consists in two classes: *BaseCRUD* and *BaseRepository*. 
**BaseCRUD** is the basic class that implements the basic CRUD operations, while **BaseRepository** is the repository used to execute those operations. You could also write your own repository class and use basic CRUD operation provided by **BaseRepository** class by extending it to your own repository class!

### Installation
##### Using pip
`pip install sqlmodel-basecrud`

##### Using poetry
`poetry add sqlmodel-basecrud`

Or you can clone the entire repository from this page.

### Usage

### What's  next
The first thing that comes to my mind is to extend the features of Async to BaseCRUD class.
